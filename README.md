winexpect
---

A helper tool for GUI testing automation to use along with
ActivateApp/SendKeys. The use case is when you want to SendKeys but are
not sure if the control you're targeting has yet appeared. winexpect.exe
takes a string and waits until there is a window on its desktop with
window text containing given string.
